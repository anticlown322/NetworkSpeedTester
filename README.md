# :eyes: Overview

This repository contains a simple C# program that checks the speed and quality of your internet connection.

## :mag: Details

- .NET Framework 4.8
- WPF
- MVVM Pattern

I tried to implement a MVVM pattern. I think it turned out well. Also I created some custom components e.g. speedometer, buttons.
For collecting general info about connection I used [IPInfo](https://ipinfo.io/) API.

Project has some bugs(like not calculating upload speed or different exceptions) and unfinished features(speedometer has no animation,
there is no settings section, server list is to little so app may output incorrect results). I will not continue the project,
so I hope that you will at least enjoy what is there
